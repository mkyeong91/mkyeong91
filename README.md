# Hey there 👋 I'm MK 

💻 **Engineer | Debugger | Builder of diagnostic & automation tools**

I’ve spent the last 10+ years tinkering with diagnostic platforms and automation in the semiconductor world.  
Most of my work lives at the intersection of **hardware + software**, where I try to make things faster, smarter, and easier for the teams around me.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- AI + cloud + DevOps mashups  
- Building reusable frameworks for debugging and troubleshooting  
- Growing into Staff/Architect roles while keeping hands-on with code  
- Practicing social confidence (because tech isn’t the only system worth optimizing 😉)

## 🎨 Hobbies
Outside of engineering, I enjoy practicing **Chinese calligraphy** ✍️ — a way to slow down, focus, and connect with tradition.
